# Changelog

All notable changes to okf are recorded here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and
this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `okf --version` flag, printing the package version plus the short git commit
  hash the binary was built from, e.g. `okf v0.1.0.0 (445fd16)`. The hash is read
  from `.git/` at compile time under `cabal build` and injected by Nix (CPP
  `GIT_HASH` macro) under `nix build`; a dirty tree reports `(dirty)`.

## [0.1.0.0] - 2026-06-19

Initial release.

### Added

- `okf-core` library: OKF document parser (`Okf.Document`), bundle graph
  indexing (`Okf.Index`, `Okf.Graph`), bundle validation with referential
  integrity (`Okf.Validation`, `Okf.Bundle`), concept construction and bundle
  writing, concept-link rendering with a round-trip guarantee, and a frontmatter
  authoring API.
- `okf-cli` library and `okf` executable: bundle validation and document
  authoring commands over the core API.
