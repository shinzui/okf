PROFILE-BASED VALIDATION

A profile descriptor declares house conventions layered on top of OKF: which
type strings are allowed, which frontmatter keys are required, which
resource:// schemes are expected, the file layout, and required # Schema
columns. Profiles are written as Dhall descriptors.

USAGE

  okf validate BUNDLE --profile PROFILE.dhall
  okf validate BUNDLE --profile PROFILE.dhall --profile-enforce

ADVISORY VS ENFORCED

  --profile PROFILE      Run profile checks after structural validation.
                         Deviations print to stderr, each line prefixed
                         "profile:". By default they are advisory and do NOT
                         change the exit code.

  --profile-enforce      Make profile deviations fail the command (non-zero
                         exit).

EXIT CODES

  - Structural errors always exit non-zero, with or without --profile.
  - Profile deviations exit 0 by default (advisory), or non-zero with
    --profile-enforce.
  - A descriptor that fails to load is always a hard error.

EXAMPLE (ADVISORY)

  profile: schemas/sales/tables/bad: type not in profile vocabulary: pg table
  OK: 3 concepts
  profile: 1 advisory deviation(s) (use --profile-enforce to fail)
